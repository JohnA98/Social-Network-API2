# Social-Network-API

## Description

This is a sample backend for a social network API. I wondered how social networks survive, and more importantly, what their backbone looks like. With this application, I was able to get a slight grasp of what one could look like. This application uses mongoDB as a database system, and uses RESTful API to complete database functions for the social network.

## Installation

You must have nodeJS and MongoDB compass installed on your computer in order to run this application. From there, you can clone the repository. Then, in your terminal run npm i to install all dependencies, and then to start the application, run node server.js. I encourage you to start with the post routes, as there is no data in the database.

## Usage

An example usage is provided here to show you how the application works.
